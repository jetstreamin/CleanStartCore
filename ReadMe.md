# Simple Enough Clean Code Start

This is my squeaky clean boilerplate for a DDD approach using .Net Core, CQRS, Fluent Validation, Mediator and Entity Framework.  It's a stripped down version of the NorthWind work Jason Tau (http://bit.ly/2RghbjJ) did at the SSWTV back in October.  Here is a link to the presentation.

Feel free to take and tweak what you find useful.  It's a can be a good starting point for an application.  Please feel free to review it as needed.  I wrote it from scratch using the Jason's NorthWind project as a guidewire.

The Intermediary class is a domain entity, that maps to an application model.  I based it off customers in the NorthWind DB. Just sharing this out there just 'cuz.  

Thanks,
